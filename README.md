# Flood prediction Model
### Abstract

A flood prediction model can play a key role in providing relevant information of possible impending floods in populated locations. The development of such models can reduce the damage in areas by decreasing the economic and environmental impacts of floods. More importantly, a prediction system developed for India, especially the Kerala area, can effectively lower the risk of harm and loss of life. If artificial neural network (ANN) models can provide sufficiently accurate forecasts, even one day ahead, the lead time for flood warning can be extended and the subsequent flood emergency measures can be better planned and executed.

The risk of flood is affected by factors such as land use, meteorological events,hydrology and the topology of the land.In this  project,we can explore the use of artificial neural network models to predict the onset of floods. Rainfall is considered as the primary factor influencing the likelihood of flood .

The mean percentage accuracy and correlation coefficient can be used to evaluate the performance of trained neural networks. A feed-forward model with six input neuronal units, four hidden units and one output unit can be used to produce the best predictive results for this type of neural network
