# Abstract
The risk of flood is affected by factors such as land use, meteorological events,hydrology and the topology of the land.Poverty encouraged settlement patterns that neglected flood risk in certain areas, especially in rural areas. This research explores the use of artificial neural network models to predict the onset of floods. Rainfall is considered as the primary factor influencing the likelihood of flood,and a number of artificial neural network architectures were evaluated as flood prediction models.
